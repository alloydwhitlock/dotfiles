# dotfiles

Collection of various configuration files used by Adam Whitlock. Nothing too fancy, but generic enough to be used across various hosts.

## Installation

Until the .dotfile automation script is setup, it is required to symlink
dotfiles from the appropriate user home location to the downloaded repository.

1. Clone project to localhost
2. Create symlinks from home directory to location of specific configuration files

## Contributing

2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
